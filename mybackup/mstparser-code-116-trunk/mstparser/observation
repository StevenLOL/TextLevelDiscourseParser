1. line 102 in DependencyPipe.java, I think we can change parameter of function setFeatureVector() to load our own features with pair(idex, value).

2. file format: sentence length correspond to number of edus, tags can be arbitrary to be in accordance with given format. parent can be extracted from training data, dependency label need to be discussed further.

3. still need to check if it will work. 

4. one instance correspond to one article.

5. I need to figure out where parameters are stored(already done...).

6. I need to figure out how feature vectors are stored and read, lot of doubts.

7. line 202 in DependencyPipe.java can be changed to load our own feature vector. function addCoreFeatures() matters.
